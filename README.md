# HR AnalyticsDashboard
Provides a comprehensive overview of employee data, focusing on attrition and key workforce insights.

## Purpose
The Dashboard is designed to provide a data-driven approach that enables HR teams to make informed decision based on key workforce metrics, highlight areas of concern by pinpointing specific demographics, roles, or departments requiring attention, and monitor workforce health by tracking attrition rates, job satisfaction and other metrics to maintain a stable and engaged workforce.

## Key insight and Analysis:

1. Attrition Overview

The total number of employees (1,470), employee attrition (237), and attrition rate (16.12%) provide a quick snapshot of workforce stability. If the attrition rate is higher than industry standards, HR teams can investigate the causes and develop targeted retention strategies.

2. Salary and Attrition

Employees who leave (Attrition = Yes) have a lower average salary ($4.8K) compared to those who stay ($6.8K). Consider revising compensation policies or conducting market benchmarking to ensure competitive salaries for high-risk roles.

3. Attrition by Education Field

Employees from "Life Sciences" (37.55%) and "Medical" (26.58%) fields have the highest attrition. Explore if job satisfaction, career growth opportunities, or workload are contributing to attrition in these fields.

4. Attrition by Age Group

The 26–35 age group has the highest attrition, followed by the 18–25 group. Focus on career development programs, mentorship, and engagement initiatives for younger employees to improve retention.

6. Employee Tenure and Attrition

Attrition peaks at employees with fewer than 5 years at the company and significantly drops afterward. Strengthen onboarding, training, and early-career development programs to retain employees during their initial years.

6. Job Role and Satisfaction

Roles such as "Sales Executive" and "Laboratory Technician" show lower job satisfaction levels (ratings 1 and 2) and higher attrition rates. Roles like "Research Scientist" and "Healthcare Representative" have mixed satisfaction ratings (3 and 4) but still experience notable attrition. Roles such as "Manager" and "Research Director" show higher satisfaction levels (ratings 3 and 4) and lower attrition rates. The uneven distribution of satisfaction scores highlights specific roles needing targeted improvement efforts.
Conduct role-specific surveys to understand dissatisfaction and take corrective measures, such as workload redistribution, recognition programs, or upskilling. Align roles with employees' skills and interests to foster engagement and retention. For Roles with High Satisfaction and Low Attrition, Maintain and replicate best practices from these roles across other departments. Recognize and reward high-performing employees to sustain satisfaction and motivation.

7. Gender Distribution

The gender comparison in the dashboards reveals that male employees  outnumber female employees, contributing to a higher total attrition count. However, female employees may face unique challenges that could impact their retention, such as work-life balance or career advancement opportunities. Understanding job role distribution by gender might also uncover biases in hiring or promotion. Monitoring metrics like salary differences and job satisfaction levels by gender could provide deeper insights into workplace equity and potential disparities.
To address these findings, the organization should implement targeted gender equity initiatives, such as mentorship programs for women and pay equity analyses to ensure fairness in compensation. Offering flexible work arrangements and benefits can support employees in managing personal and professional responsibilities. Additionally, conducting engagement surveys to understand gender-specific challenges and introducing bias training can help create an inclusive work environment. Setting measurable goals for improving gender balance in hiring and leadership positions and tracking progress through dashboards will further support diversity and retention efforts.
